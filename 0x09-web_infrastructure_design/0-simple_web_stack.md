```SPOF```
Since all components are hosted on a single server, any failure in hardware, software, or network connectivity could lead to downtime for the entire website.

```Downtime During Maintenance:```
While the server is being updated or repaired, the website is not accessible, causing temporary downtime.

```Limited Scalability:```
The infrastructure may struggle to handle increased traffic during peak periods, as scaling options are limited by the resources of the single server. This can lead to degraded performance or even website downtime during periods of high traffic.
